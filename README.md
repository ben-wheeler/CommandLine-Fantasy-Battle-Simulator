# ABOUT PROJECT
This project works as a command-line character creator. It allows a user to create a character, with a name of their choosing, a race from a setlist (including elf, human and orc), and a type from a setlist (including `rouge`, `wizard` and `warrior`).
Each character created will have 5 unique stats (`Strength`, `Constitution`, `Finesse`, `Intelligence`, and `Perception`) starting with a base skill level of 14 but increasing/decreasing based on the chosen race and type. After the type and race are chosen the player will then be able to pick a name and age, this will then all be printed in the console.
The program also creates a randomly generated opponent for the player, that will battle against them using one of the 5 randomly chosen stats. Depending on who has a higher value in that stat, determines the winner and the result will be printed in the console.
